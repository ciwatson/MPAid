# MPAid
Maori Pronunciation Aid from University of Auckland.

# Installation Notes
The installer is too large to be committed to the repository. To get the install files, head to the YsqEvilmax fork of MPAid, and download release 1.6. This is a temporary fix, a subsequent release will have the install files on this fork.
